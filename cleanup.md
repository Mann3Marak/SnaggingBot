## Audit Checklist

- [x] **Inspection UI** – confirm `_baseline.tsx:1` is only a legacy copy of `src/components/inspection/NHomeVoiceInspection.tsx:1`; if no engineer relies on it, archive or remove so edits happen in a single source.
- [x] **Legacy OneDrive Code** – with storage now handled in Supabase, remove or archive OneDrive-era artifacts (`src/lib/nhome-onedrive-manager.ts:1`, `ConnectOneDrive` component, `onedrive_manager_e1684e3.ts:1`, related API routes) and update docs so future work doesn’t revive the deprecated path.
- [x] **Legacy Layout Sandbox** – decide whether `UI components/layout.tsx:1`, `UI components/globals.css:1`, and `UI components/tailwind.config.ts:1` are still required for experiments; if not, move them to documentation or delete to avoid diverging from `src/app/layout.tsx:1` and `src/app/globals.css:1`.
- [x] **Voice Test Route** – either reinstate a controlled route under `src/app/voice/test` or remove `Redundent/voice/test/page.tsx:1`; verify no QA scripts depend on the redundant path.
- [x] **Example Voice Prototype** – confirm `Example Files/app.js:1` and `Example Files/index.js:1` are only for historical reference; if so, migrate them to docs or delete to prevent confusion with the production voice workflow.
- [x] **Backups Snapshot** – review `backups/pre-step1/src/**` to determine whether you still need the pre-refactor snapshot; if it’s only for version history, archive outside the repo and update onboarding docs.
- [x] **Checklist Builder Scripts** – inventory usage of `scripts/build_checklist_sql.py:1`, `scripts/build_checklists_v2.py:1`, `scripts/build_checklists_v3.py:1`, `scripts/build_checklists_full_reset.py:1`, `scripts/build_T2_checklist_from_text.py:1`, and `scripts/build_T2_from_list_text2.py:1`; retire superseded versions and document the canonical script.
- [x] **Supabase Migrations** – document which checklist rebuild scripts (`supabase/migrations/20250922150000_checklists_from_excel.sql:1`, `20250922161500_checklists_rebuild.sql:1`, `20250922172951_checklists_rebuild_v3.sql:1`) remain necessary; if earlier ones are obsolete, note why they stay (history) or remove after confirming they’ve been applied.
- [x] **Dormant Helpers** – prune or wire up unused code (`addNHomeWatermark` and `createNHomePhotoMetadata` in `src/components/camera/NHomeCameraCapture.tsx:79/102`, `createNHomeReportFolder` in `src/components/reports/NHomeReportGenerator.tsx:64`) so dead paths don’t mislead future refactors.
- [x] **Auth & Voice Stubs** – validate any comments or placeholders (e.g., `src/components/voice/NHomeVoiceTest.tsx:1`, unused state in `src/components/inspection/NHomeVoiceInspection.tsx:1`) and either remove or flag them in tech debt docs to prevent assumptions of working features.
- [x] **TypeScript Scope** – after cleanup, adjust `tsconfig.json:21` `exclude` list if needed so archived snapshots or experiments aren’t reintroduced into the type-check pipeline.
